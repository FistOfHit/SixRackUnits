This is the SixRackUnits AI hardware newsletter, keeping you up to date with the latest in AI hardware, datacentre technology, and the future of compute. In addition, we also cover vendors of anything interesting in the space, as well as short "one-pagers" on a random topic that we find interesting (and hope you do too).

For a space to share sources and news/updates, check out the <a href="https://sixrackunits.substack.com/notes">notes</a> section of this newsletter or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitesh-kumar58">LinkedIn</a> for posts on similar topics!
