*What if interconnects became zero-latency when it came to distance? What about zero-latency for multiplexing/de-multiplexing, buffering, decoding etc.? Or what if there was no latency between a chip accessing a memory region in any other chip it was working with on a program, regardless of where that other chip is? How would that change compute and memory?*
