This is the SixRackUnits AI hardware newsletter, keeping you up to date with the latest in AI hardware, datacentre technology, and the future of compute. With a field changing this fast, staying on top and even summarising all the material available can be difficult - so we do it for you.

# This month's updates:

## Broadcom's inevitable yet surprising new chip - Tomahawk Ultra

- Pin-to-pin compatible with Tomahawk 5, designed for quick deployment in existing boards and chassis
- Aimed for scale up
- 250ns switching latency, 77B pps at 64B, unsure the latency at higher packet sizes
- Designed around SUE, architecture fundamentally different to T5
- Broadcom aiming to capture scale out and scale up markets with upcoming t6

## GB300 servers possibly shipping before 4Q25, "no major issues" allegedly

---

## JEDEC releases the LPDDR6 standards, samples potentially out by 4Q25

## The surprising mystery of Diamond rapids' leaked TDP

- DMR doesnt have SMT [source](https://x.com/InstLatX64/status/1948734994798567678)
- 500W TDP seems suspiciously low, unsure if thats for a mid-spec version or for the 192 core version
- Granite rapids reaches 500W TDP, peaks at 128 cores at 2.0GHz [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite_Rapids), and is restricted to a two socket version. This one says a 4s version. There must be some caveats here or restrictions for being only 500W TDP. 
- In comparison AMD TUrin CPUs hit 192 cores already within a 500W envelope [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyc), and rumours are that Venice will hit 600W at a much lower core count [](https://wccftech.com/amd-zen-6-epyc-venice-zen-6-cpus-256-cores-2026-epyc-verano-zen-7-instinct-mi500-gpus-2027/)
