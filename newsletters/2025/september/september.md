*Will those of us born today be able to live without AI? Given how much of humanity now exists in a state of dependence on technology in some way or the other, and the subset of that population that is dependent on their smartphones, it's natural to think that a much smaller but rapidly growing subset is now dependent on AI-powered tools. Is that the ultimate plan for those who develop our AI models? To create a world in which AI is absolutely necessary, making their existence also, absolutely necessary?*

This is the SixRackUnits AI hardware newsletter, keeping you up to date with the latest in AI hardware, datacentre technology, and the future of compute. With a field changing this fast, staying on top of everything, or even summarising all the material available can be difficult - so we do it for you.
