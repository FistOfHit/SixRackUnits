# SixRackUnits
SixRackUnits (6RU) delivers short form news and educational content around AI/HPC hardware.

## About
Originally designed for Substack but published here first, this monthly newsletter/blog is part-time market analyst work done for keeping people up to date with developments in the field of AI/HPC hardware. For anyone interested in what happens within and between servers, this publication presents a technical - but not an expert - view on news, as well as educational content on relevant topics.

For a space to share sources and news/updates, check out the <a href="https://sixrackunits.substack.com/notes">notes</a> section of this newsletter or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitesh-kumar58">LinkedIn</a> for posts on similar topics!

## Why Github?

Secondarily, this writing being backed by Git helps preserve its history and protects its future. Finally, it helps my commit history look good.
