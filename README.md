# SixRackUnits
SixRackUnits (6RU) delivers short form news and educational content around AI/HPC hardware.

## About
Originally designed for Substack but published internally first, this monthly newsletter/blog is part-time market analyst work done for keeping various teams within the organisation up to date with developments in the field of AI/HPC hardware. For anyone interested in what happens within and between servers, this publication presents a technical - but not an expert - view on news, as well as educational content on relevant topics.

## Why Github?
The purpose of this repository is primarily to have finer control over the update frequency, issue layout, and the formatting/filetype available to all possible readers on any reasonable platform. Secondarily, this writing being backed by Git helps preserve its history and protects its future. Finally, it helps my commit history look good.
